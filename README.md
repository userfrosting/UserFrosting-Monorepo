   ...or use the VSCode `==> Serve` pre-configured task.

## Composer

The monorepo is managed by [Monorepo-builder](https://github.com/symplify/monorepo-builder) on the Composer side.   
It's important to edit the individual package `composer.json`, not the root one. After each update, run this command.

```
vendor/bin/monorepo-builder merge
```

## Release
   
To release a new version, for example `6.0`, run this command. Composer will be updated, as well as NPM and a git tag will be pushed using the local user :

```
vendor/bin/monorepo-builder release 6.0
```

Or:

```
vendor/bin/monorepo-builder release patch
```

You can use `minor` and `major` too.
