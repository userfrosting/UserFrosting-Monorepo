UserFrosting is a secure, modern user management system written in PHP and built on top of the [Slim Microframework](http://www.slimframework.com/), [Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/) templating engine, and [Eloquent](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/eloquent#introduction) ORM.

This **Core Sprinkle** provides most of the "heavy lifting" PHP code. It provides all the necessary services for database, templating, error handling, mail support, request throttling, and more.

## Installation in your UserFrosting project
To use this sprinkle in your UserFrosting project, follow theses instructions (*N.B.: This sprinkle is enabled by default when using the base app template*).

1. Require in your [UserFrosting](https://github.com/userfrosting/UserFrosting) project : 
    ```
    composer require userfrosting/sprinkle-core
    ```

2. Add the Sprinkle to your Sprinkle Recipe : 
    ```php
    public function getSprinkles(): array
    {
        return [
            \UserFrosting\Sprinkle\Core\Core::class,
        ];
    }
    ```

3. Bake
    ```bash
    php bakery bake
    ```

## Install locally and run tests
You can also install this sprinkle locally. This can be useful to debug or contribute to this sprinkle. 

1. Clone repo :
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/userfrosting/sprinkle-core.git
    ```
2. Change directory
    ```
    cd sprinkle-core
    ```
3. Install dependencies :
    ```
    composer install
    ```
4. Run bake command :

    ```

From this point, you can use the same command as with any other sprinkle.

```
